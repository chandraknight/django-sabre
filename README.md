The all-in-one django app to communicate Sabre GDS REST and SOAP APIs


# Description:
While working on a project that utilise the Sabre GDS APIs, I fell that there isn't a single python library that is scoped on both REST and SOAP APIs together. Sabre doesn't have all in all its functionalities in a single API paradigism, you will find that some APIs are available in REST and some are in SOAP. Soremaining with any single won't solve someone's problem if he want to utilises wholes features and functionalities. I have tried solve this need by implementing this easy to use django app. Although I have focused on django framework, but you can use it in any python application due to its highly generalised pattern.
